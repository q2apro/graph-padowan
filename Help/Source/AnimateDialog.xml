	<para>
		This dialog is used to create an animation by changing a custom constant.
		The animation can be played directly, saved to a file or copied into a document.
		The animation can contain all elements supported by Graph, for example functions, relations, point series, labels, etc.
	</para>

	<variablelist>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>Constant</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Here you select which constant you want to change in the animation.
					The constant must already have been created in the <xref linkend="CustomFunctionsDialog" /> dialog.
					The selected constant will be changed in each frame in the animation.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>Range</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					In the <guilabel>From</guilabel> and <guilabel>To</guilabel> fields you need to specify the range of the selected constant in the animation.
					The <guilabel>Step</guilabel> value indicates how much the constant is changed between two frames.
					The number of frames is given by (<guilabel>To</guilabel> - <guilabel>From</guilabel>) / <guilabel>Step</guilabel>.
					More frames will give a smoother animation but it will also take longer to create and take up more space in the disk file.

				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>Frame information</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					You can specify the image size of the animation.
					This will affect the file size and the time it takes to create the animation.
					The <guilabel>Frames/second</guilabel> indicates the default speed of the animation.
					Most players will be able to adjust the speed when the animation is played.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
	</variablelist>

	<para>
		When you press the <guibutton>Animate</guibutton> button, an animation is created from the settings you have specified.
		This may take some time depending on what elements exist in the coordinate system and how many frames are needed.
	</para>
	<para>
		When the animation is finished, a very simple player is shown.
		You can use this to play the animation.
		The <guibutton><inlinegraphic fileref="AnimationMenu.png" scale="60"/></guibutton> button will give you some additional options.
	</para>
	<variablelist>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>Speed</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Here you can change the playback speed.
					This will only affect the playback and not the file saved.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>Repeat</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					When checked the animation will continue playing. When finished it will start over again.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>Auto reverse</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					This will make the animation run backwards when it reaches the end.
					This is most useful in combination with the <guimenuitem>Repeat</guimenuitem> option, which will make the animation oscillate between the two ends.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>Save as...</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					This will save the animation as an Audio Video Interleave (avi) file, which can be played by any media player.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>Save frame...</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					This will save the currently shown frame as a bitmap file.
					This can be either Windows Bitmap (bmp), Portable Network Graphics (png) or Joint Photographic Experts Group (jpeg).
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>Save all frames...</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					This will save all frames as single bitmap files.
					This is the same as repeating <guimenuitem>Save frame...</guimenuitem> for each frame in the animation.
				</para>
